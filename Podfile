# LiveKit is NOT a CocoaPods dependency: CocoaPods trunk stopped publishing LiveKitClient at
# 2.0.18, and 2.0.18+'s LiveKitUniFFI dependency was never published to trunk at all, so our
# actual LiveKit version (2.17.0, needed for AudioManager/audio-session fixes — see the voice
# design docs) cannot be resolved via CocoaPods. It's added as a native Xcode Swift Package
# dependency directly on the AEPBrandConcierge and ConciergeDemoApp targets instead (see
# AEPBrandConcierge.xcodeproj's Package Dependencies). This means CocoaPods-based external
# consumers of AEPBrandConcierge currently cannot get the voice feature — tracked as an open
# question in voice-livekit-connection-bootstrap-design.md (OQ-1).
