# LiveKit Voice — Room Connection & Bootstrap — Requirements & Design

**Status:** Draft — pending team review
**Scope:** How the iOS SDK obtains LiveKit connection credentials (bootstrap), connects to the
LiveKit `Room`, publishes the mic, parses the worker's data-channel messages, and surfaces
voice-turn content to the user. Assumes the AVAudioSession design
(`voice-livekit-audio-session-design.md`) for audio-session/routing concerns — this document does
not repeat those. Does not cover detailed voice-mode UI states/visuals (separate doc) or Android.

**Revision note (2026-09-14):** §4 FR-05, §6.5, §8, and §9 Phase 3 were revised to reflect a
strategy pivot recorded in the vault ADR-011 — the first iteration deliberately ships a minimal,
ChatGPT-voice-mode-style UI (no live per-turn content during the call; a plain transcript once the
session ends) rather than reusing the existing chat transcript live, per FR-05. Richer live UI
(cards/CTAs, incremental streaming text) is treated as an on-demand follow-up, added only if
requested after the first demo, not built into this iteration. See ADR-011 for the full rationale.
**Audience:** iOS team (implementation + review) and `brand-concierge-web-agent` developers
(parity review). Every iOS decision below is cross-referenced against its web equivalent
(`voiceCommands.ts`, `VoiceTransport.ts`, `LiveKitVoiceManager.ts`, `LiveKitContracts.ts`).

---

## 1. Background & Problem Statement

### Current state

- `ChatController` (`AEPBrandConcierge/Sources/Controllers/ChatController.swift`) owns the only
  existing turn pipeline: `sendMessage` → `streamAgentResponse` → `ConciergeChatService.streamChat`
  (a `URLSession` SSE POST to the CCS `/brand-concierge/conversations` endpoint) → chunks decoded
  as `ConversationPayload`/`ConversationResponse` → appended into `@Published var messages`, with
  `chatState` gating the composer/mic (`micEnabled`, `sendEnabled`, `composerEditable`).
- `ConversationResponse` (`Models/Network/ConversationResponse.swift`) has fields for `message`,
  `promptSuggestions`, `multimodalElements`, `sources`, `linkHints`, `state`, `feedback` — **no
  `voice` field exists today.** Web's equivalent wire shape already carries a `response.voice`
  object (`VoicePayload` in `AudioStreaming.ts`) that iOS's model does not yet decode.
- `SpeechController`/`SpeechCapturer` (dictation) is a sibling of the chat pipeline: it turns
  speech into text that lands in the composer (`InputController`), and never touches the network
  or `messages` directly. It has no data-channel or WebRTC concept at all.
- No LiveKit dependency exists anywhere in this repo today (`Package.swift`, `Podfile`,
  `AEPBrandConcierge.podspec` — verified, none reference it).
- `ChatController`, `ChatView`, and every message-rendering view (`MessageListView`,
  `BasicMessageView`, etc.) are **internal** to the `AEPBrandConcierge` module (no `public`
  modifier) — a host app (including `ConciergeDemoApp`) cannot reach into `messages` or push a new
  bubble into the transcript from outside the framework. Only `Concierge.show(...)`/`.present(...)`
  and the `SpeechCapturing`/`TextSpeaking` protocols are public seams.

### Gap

Porting web's full_cycle voice flow (bootstrap over the same conversation-event channel → connect
`Room` → publish mic → receive transcript/turn state over the data channel → render as chat
turns) requires, and today has none of:

1. A wire-compatible way to request LiveKit connection credentials without a new endpoint (mirror
   web's reuse of `sendConversationDataEvent`/`bootstrapVoice`).
2. A `Room` connection + mic publish + remote-audio subscribe (LiveKit SDK not yet a dependency).
3. A Swift-side parser for the worker's data-channel JSON contract
   (`transcript_delta`/`turn_done`/`session_notice`/`ui_payload`/`text_input_error`) — this
   contract is defined by the shared backend worker, not by either client, so the JSON shape must
   match web's byte-for-byte, not be reinvented.
4. A way to get voice-turn content into the existing chat transcript UI, given `ChatController`/
   `messages` are internal to the module (see Rejected Alternatives).

### Comparison table

| Scenario | Current Behavior (text turn) | Desired Behavior (voice turn) |
|---|---|---|
| Getting a server response | `ConciergeChatService.streamChat` posts a `message`-shaped conversation event, decodes SSE chunks into `ConversationPayload` | A `livekit-bootstrap`-shaped conversation event is posted on the **same** endpoint/session; the SSE response carries a `response.voice` object with `type: "livekit_session"`, `livekitUrl`, `token` instead of `message` |
| Real-time transport | None — one request, one streamed text response | A LiveKit `Room` (WebRTC) carries the mic track out and a remote (TTS) audio track + JSON data-channel messages in |
| Turn content reaching the UI | `streamAgentResponse`'s `onChunk`/`onComplete` mutate `messages`/`chatState` directly, rendering incrementally as the response streams | **v1 (this doc):** no live per-turn UI during the call — a new voice-session controller buffers turn content and appends it to `messages` as a plain transcript once the session ends, ChatGPT-voice-mode-style. Live incremental rendering and rich content (cards/CTAs) mirroring the text-turn path are deferred to a later iteration (see FR-05, ADR-011) |
| Mic control | `SpeechController`/`InputController` gate on `chatState == .idle` | New voice session must additionally gate against dictation being active and vice versa (per `voice-livekit-audio-session-design.md` FR-08, already confirmed: dictation available only when voice session is off) |

---

## 2. Rejected Alternatives

**Option A — Build voice entirely inside `ConciergeDemoApp` (or the host app), outside the SDK,
with its own UI.** Rejected: `ChatController`, `ChatView`, and the message-rendering views are all
internal to the `AEPBrandConcierge` module. A host app has no public way to append a bubble to the
existing transcript or to reuse `MessageListView`/`BasicMessageView`. Building a second, parallel
chat UI outside the SDK just to keep LiveKit out of the SDK would be substantially *more* work
than adding voice inside the SDK, and would visually diverge from the existing chat — the opposite
of what a fast, demoable PoC needs.

**Option B — Add the LiveKit Swift SDK as a dependency of the existing single `AEPBrandConcierge`
target/podspec, the same tier as `AEPCore`/`AEPEdgeIdentity` today (selected for this task — see
Proposal).** Simple: one dependency line in `Package.swift`, the Podfile's `lib_main`/`lib_dev`
groups, and the podspec. Trade-off: every consumer of `AEPBrandConcierge` — even one that never
enables voice — now links LiveKit + WebRTC's compiled binary, which is a non-trivial size increase
compared to today's footprint. Accepted as the pragmatic choice for a 2-4 week demo, with an
explicit follow-up requirement (Open Question OQ-1) to revisit before any release beyond the Kings
PoC.

**Option C — Split voice into a second SPM library product / CocoaPods subspec (e.g.
`AEPBrandConciergeVoice`) that depends on core `AEPBrandConcierge` and is the only place LiveKit is
linked, so non-voice consumers pay nothing.** This is the architecturally correct long-term shape —
it mirrors how large SDKs ship optional heavy capabilities — but rejected for *this* task: it
requires restructuring `Package.swift`'s single-target layout and the CocoaPods podspec into
subspecs/multiple products, which is nontrivial scaffolding with no existing precedent in this repo
(the existing optional-capability pattern, `SpeechCapturing`/`TextSpeaking`, is a protocol
injected by the host app, not a separately-compiled module — it doesn't solve the "avoid linking a
heavy binary" problem the way a subspec would). Given the timeline, this is deferred, not solved,
by this design (see Open Question OQ-1).

---

## 3. Proposal

- Add the LiveKit Swift SDK as a direct dependency of the `AEPBrandConcierge` target (Option B),
  flagged for reassessment (OQ-1) before any release beyond this PoC.
- Add a small `voice: VoicePayload?` field to `ConversationResponse`, and a new `VoicePayload`
  model mirroring web's `AudioStreaming.ts` shape (only the fields actually consumed: `type`,
  `livekitUrl`, `token` — matching web's own "narrower than the wire payload" precedent). This is
  additive and backward compatible: `ConversationResponse` has no explicit `CodingKeys`/custom
  decoder, so Swift's synthesized `Codable` conformance already tolerates the new optional key
  being absent on ordinary text-turn responses.
- Add a bootstrap method to `ConciergeChatService` that posts a `livekit-bootstrap`-typed
  conversation event on the *same* endpoint/session/auth-token/consent plumbing `streamChat`
  already uses, and resolves once `response.voice.type == "livekit_session"` arrives — mirrors
  web's reuse of `sendConversationDataEvent`/`bootstrapVoice` riding the same SSE channel as text.
- Add `VoiceSessionController` (new file, sibling to `SpeechController`), owned by
  `ChatController`, that owns the LiveKit `Room`: connect using the bootstrapped credentials,
  publish the mic track (per the AVAudioSession doc's FR-01/FR-02), subscribe to the remote audio
  track, and parse data-channel JSON into a small Swift mirror of `DataChannelMessage`. Unlike
  web's split between `VoiceTransport.ts` (raw WebRTC plumbing) and `LiveKitVoiceManager.ts` (turn
  state machine) — a split driven by browser-specific concerns (autoplay policy, ReadableStream
  feature detection) that don't exist on iOS — this PoC combines both concerns into one controller.
  Revisit the split if the combined controller becomes unwieldy (Open Question OQ-2 candidate, not
  raised as blocking now).
- `ChatController` gains `startVoiceSession()`/`stopVoiceSession()`. **v1 does not stream turn
  content live**: `VoiceSessionController` buffers transcript/turn content as it arrives, and
  `ChatController` appends it to `messages` as a plain text transcript only once the voice session
  ends — mirroring a ChatGPT-voice-mode-style UI rather than the text turn's incremental
  rendering. This is a deliberate scope choice (see ADR-011): it's the fastest working voice UI to
  ship for the first demo, not a technical conclusion that live rendering is wrong. `ChatView`/
  `MessageListView` are still reused unmodified for displaying that post-call transcript — only
  the *timing* of when content reaches `messages` changes, not the rendering path.
- The data-channel message *type names and field names* are copied verbatim from
  `LiveKitContracts.ts` (`transcript_delta`, `turn_done`, `session_notice`, `ui_payload`,
  `text_input_error`, `fullText`, `turnId`, etc.) — the worker on the other end is the same backend
  process regardless of client language, so the wire contract is not iOS's to redesign.

## 4. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-01 | The app shall request LiveKit connection credentials by sending a `livekit-bootstrap`-typed event over the existing CCS conversation-event channel (same endpoint, session, auth token, and consent handling as a normal chat turn), and shall not depend on any statically configured LiveKit URL/token. |
| FR-02 | The app shall decode a `response.voice` object with `type == "livekit_session"` carrying `livekitUrl` and `token` from the bootstrap response, mirroring web's `LiveKitSessionBootstrap`. |
| FR-03 | Once bootstrapped, the app shall connect a LiveKit `Room` using the returned URL/token, publish the local mic track (per the AVAudioSession doc), and subscribe to the worker's published remote audio track. |
| FR-04 | The app shall parse inbound data-channel messages into the same message-type set as web (`transcript_delta`, `turn_done`, `session_notice`, `ui_payload`, `text_input_error`), using the same field names/types, so the shared backend worker's wire contract is honored without client-specific translation. |
| FR-05 | **(Revised 2026-09-14, see ADR-011)** For the first iteration, the app shall not render voice-turn content live during the call. `VoiceSessionController` shall buffer transcript/turn content (user transcript, assistant response) as it arrives over the data channel, and the app shall append it to the existing `messages` array as a plain-text transcript only once the voice session ends — a ChatGPT-voice-mode-style UI, not a live-updating one. Live incremental rendering, and rich content (product cards/CTAs via `ui_payload`) rendered during the call, are deferred to a later iteration and added only on request (e.g. if Mehul asks for web parity after seeing the first demo) — not built into this iteration. |
| FR-06 | The app shall gate the dictation mic button and the voice-session control as mutually exclusive, consistent with `voice-livekit-audio-session-design.md` FR-08. |
| FR-07 | A failed bootstrap (network error, malformed response, no `livekit_session` payload) shall surface a user-visible error and return the app to its pre-voice-session state, using error handling of the same quality as the existing text-turn failure path (`onComplete(error)` in `streamChat`) — no special-case hardening beyond that, per the resolved understanding that prior "backend flakiness" was a stage-config issue, not a systemic bootstrap reliability problem. |

### Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| NFR-01 | The LiveKit Swift SDK dependency shall be added at the `AEPBrandConcierge` target/podspec level (not scoped to `ConciergeDemoApp` only), consistent with Option B — see OQ-1 for the follow-up on whether this should later move to an optional module. |
| NFR-02 | The new `voice` field on `ConversationResponse` and any new voice-specific model types shall not change the decoding behavior of existing text-turn responses (additive, optional fields only). |
| NFR-03 | Data-channel message type/field names shall match `LiveKitContracts.ts` exactly (case-sensitive), since the backend worker's contract is shared across clients. |

### Out of Scope

- Android (explicitly sequenced after iOS per the pilot's plan).
- XDM/analytics payload parity between web and mobile (explicitly deferred to a separate
  documentation-only follow-up, per CR's instruction).
- Full resilience hardening (processing/reconnect watchdogs, generation-token guarding against
  stale async callbacks, optimistic-mute rollback) that `LiveKitVoiceManager.ts` implements for
  browser-specific failure modes — get the happy path working first; add hardening only for
  failure modes actually observed on-device, not speculatively.
- Deciding the long-term SDK-modularization question (Option C) — tracked as OQ-1.
- Voice-mode UI visual states/animations — separate design doc.
- Live per-turn UI during the call (incremental transcript rendering, cards/CTAs via `ui_payload`
  shown mid-call) — deliberately deferred per FR-05/ADR-011's strategy of shipping the fastest
  working UI first and adding richness only on request.

## 5. System Architecture

### Component mapping (web → iOS)

| Web | iOS (proposed) |
|---|---|
| `chatApi.sendConversationDataEvent` (Alloy `sendConversationEvent`) | `ConciergeChatService` bootstrap method (new), reusing `streamChat`'s URL/session/payload plumbing |
| `voiceCommands.ts` (`bootstrapVoice`, mic pre-acquire, transport singleton) | `VoiceSessionController` (new) |
| `VoiceTransport.ts` (Room, track publish, data-channel send/receive, remote audio) | `VoiceSessionController` (combined, see Proposal) |
| `LiveKitVoiceManager.ts` (turn state machine, barge-in, watchdogs) | `VoiceSessionController` (combined for PoC; state machine subset only — no watchdogs yet, see Out of Scope) |
| `LiveKitContracts.ts` (wire types) | New Swift types in `Models/Voice/` (new group), field-for-field mirror |
| React/DOM chat UI consuming `StreamingCallbackData` | Existing `ChatController.messages` / `ChatView` (reused, not duplicated) |

### Data flow for one voice turn

```
User taps voice-mode control (dictation control is hidden/disabled per FR-06)
   │
   ▼
ChatController.startVoiceSession()
   │
   ▼
VoiceSessionController.bootstrap()
   │  → ConciergeChatService posts { type: "livekit-bootstrap", publishMic: true } as a
   │    conversation event, same endpoint/session/auth as streamChat
   │
   ▼
SSE response decodes into ConversationPayload.response.voice
   (type == "livekit_session", livekitUrl, token)
   │
   ▼
VoiceSessionController.connectRoom(livekitUrl, token)
   │  → LiveKit Room.connect(); publish mic track (AVAudioSession config from the
   │    companion design doc); subscribe to worker's remote audio track
   │
   ▼
Data channel messages arrive (transcript_delta / turn_done / session_notice / ui_payload)
   │  → parsed into Swift DataChannelMessage mirror
   │
   ▼
ChatController appends/updates a Message in `messages`, updates `chatState`
   (same shape as streamAgentResponse's onChunk/onComplete handling)
   │
   ▼
ChatView/MessageListView render the turn — no new rendering code needed
```

## 6. Detailed Design

### 6.1 Dependency addition

- `Package.swift`: add `.package(url: "<LiveKit Swift SDK repo>", ...)` to `dependencies`, and the
  corresponding `.product(name: "LiveKit", package: "...")` to the `AEPBrandConcierge` target's
  `dependencies`.
- `Podfile`: add `pod 'LiveKit'` (or the SDK's actual pod name) to `lib_main`/`lib_dev`, so it
  flows through to `AEPBrandConcierge`, `UnitTests`, and `ConciergeDemoApp` targets identically
  (this repo's existing pattern for AEPCore/AEPServices).
- `AEPBrandConcierge.podspec`: add `s.dependency 'LiveKit', ...` alongside the existing AEPCore/
  AEPServices/AEPEdgeIdentity lines.
- Exact SDK version/pod name to be confirmed once evaluated against the AVAudioSession doc's OQ-1
  (the `AudioManager` configuration hook) — the two design docs share this dependency-version
  decision; don't pin a version in one without checking the other.

### 6.2 Wire model additions

New file `Models/Network/VoicePayload.swift`:

```swift
/// Mirrors web's `VoicePayload` (AudioStreaming.ts) — narrower than the full wire
/// shape; only the fields the client actually consumes.
public struct VoicePayload: Codable {
    public let type: String // "livekit_session" | "done" | ... (other values ignored)
    public let livekitUrl: String?
    public let token: String?
}
```

`ConversationResponse.swift` — add one field:

```swift
public struct ConversationResponse: Codable {
    public let message: String
    public let promptSuggestions: [String]?
    public let multimodalElements: MultimodalElements?
    public let sources: [Source]?
    public let linkHints: [LinkHint]?
    public let state: String?
    public let feedback: ConversationFeedbackInfo?
    public let voice: VoicePayload?   // new
}
```

**Behavioral analysis for unchanged code:** `ConversationResponse` has no custom `init(from:)`/
`CodingKeys`, so Swift's synthesized `Decodable` conformance already decodes "extra key present,
new field absent" and "new field present, old payload shape otherwise unchanged" correctly with no
further changes — every existing call site that decodes a text-turn `ConversationResponse` keeps
working unmodified.

New `Models/Voice/` group, mirroring `LiveKitContracts.ts` type-for-type (names kept identical to
the TypeScript source for cross-repo readability): `DataChannelMessage`, `TranscriptDeltaData`,
`TurnDoneData`, `UiPayloadData`, `SessionNoticeData`, `EndReason`, `TextInputErrorMessage`. Parsing
logic (`parseDataChannelMessage` equivalent) lives alongside, in `VoiceSessionController` or a
small dedicated parser file if it grows — decide when writing the code, not preemptively split
here.

### 6.3 Bootstrap request

New method on `ConciergeChatService`, sibling to `streamChat`:

```swift
func bootstrapVoiceSession(token: String?,
                            onBootstrap: @escaping (LiveKitSessionBootstrap) -> Void,
                            onComplete: @escaping (ConciergeError?) -> Void)
```

Reuses `createUrl()` (same endpoint/session/conversation query items) and the same
auth-token/consent attachment as `createChatPayload`, but with a new payload-building method
(e.g. `createVoiceBootstrapPayload(token:)`) whose `conversation` object carries
`{ type: "livekit-bootstrap", publishMic: true }` in place of `message` — mirroring
`voiceCommands.ts`'s `eventData: { type: "livekit-bootstrap", publishMic }`. Streaming/decoding
reuses the existing `URLSessionDataDelegate` chunk-handling path; the only new logic is checking
`payload.response?.voice?.type == "livekit_session"` instead of `payload.response?.message`.

**Debug-only `USE_TEMPS` note:** `ConciergeChatService` has a `USE_TEMPS`/`TEMP_*` debug shortcut
that hardcodes an endpoint/ecid/surface for local testing (see `createUrl()`/`createChatPayload`).
The bootstrap method must be tested against both paths — confirm whether `USE_TEMPS` should also
short-circuit bootstrap, or whether voice testing requires it to be `false` (real Kings stage
config) as already established for text-turn testing (Open Question OQ-3).

### 6.4 `VoiceSessionController`

New file `AEPBrandConcierge/Sources/Controllers/VoiceSessionController.swift`, sibling to
`SpeechController`. Owns:

- The LiveKit `Room` instance, connect/disconnect lifecycle (mirrors `VoiceTransport.connectRoom`/
  `disconnectRoom`).
- Mic track publish/mute (delegates AVAudioSession specifics to the configuration established in
  the companion design doc — this controller does not itself call `AVAudioSession` APIs beyond
  what that doc specifies).
- Data-channel receive → parse → callback, mirroring `LiveKitVoiceManager`'s
  `handleRawDataChannelMessage`/`handleDataChannelMessage`, but only the subset needed for a
  working demo (see Out of Scope — no barge-in/watchdog logic yet unless trivial to include).
- A small state enum mirroring `VoiceConversationState` (`idle`/`connecting`/`listening`/
  `processing`/`responding`) sufficient to drive UI state — full parity with web's state machine
  (barge-in detection, mute-reconciliation) is explicitly deferred.

### 6.5 `ChatController` wiring

- New `private let voiceSessionController: VoiceSessionController` property, constructed alongside
  `speechController` in `init`.
- New `startVoiceSession()`/`stopVoiceSession()` methods, analogous to `startRecording()`/
  `completeMic()`. **Per the FR-05 revision, these do not stream content into `messages` turn by
  turn.** `VoiceSessionController` accumulates transcript/turn text internally as data-channel
  messages arrive (user transcript deltas, assistant `turn_done` text) for the whole voice
  session. Only on `stopVoiceSession()` does `ChatController` append the accumulated exchange to
  `messages` as one or more plain `Message` entries — a lightweight, structurally simpler version
  of `streamAgentResponse`'s accumulation pattern, without the `accumulatedContent`/
  `streamingMessageIndex` mid-stream mutation it needs for live rendering.
- `micEnabled`/`composerEditable`/`sendEnabled` computed properties gain a voice-session-active
  check (mirrors `chatState == .processing` gating today), enforcing FR-06.
- `chatState` still reflects that a voice session is in progress (so text input stays gated per
  FR-06), even though no message content appears until the session ends — the state machine and
  the content-rendering timing are independent concerns.

### 6.6 Test plan

- Unit: `createVoiceBootstrapPayload` JSON shape (mirrors existing `createChatPayloadTests`-style
  coverage for `createChatPayload`); `ConversationResponse` decode with and without a `voice` key
  present (regression-proves NFR-02); data-channel message parsing for each of the five message
  types plus malformed/unknown-type inputs (mirrors `voiceStreamingUtils.test.ts` coverage).
- Manual/integration on the Kings stage environment (now that config is resolved): full bootstrap
  → connect → speak → hear a response → turn renders in the transcript → end session → dictation
  becomes available again (ties to the AVAudioSession doc's §8 handoff scenario).

---

## 7. What Does NOT Change

| Component | Reason unchanged |
|---|---|
| `ConciergeChatService.streamChat` (text-turn path) | Bootstrap is a new sibling method reusing the same primitives (URL, session, payload helpers) — the text-turn method itself is untouched |
| `SpeechCapturer`/`TextSpeaker`/dictation flow | Separate, coexisting capability per the confirmed FR-08 decision — not modified, only gated against concurrently with voice |
| `ChatView`/`MessageListView`/message rendering views | Reused as-is — voice turns produce ordinary `Message` values, no new rendering path |
| `AEPCore`/`AEPEdgeIdentity` config/identity plumbing | Unrelated to this module |
| Theming (`Theme/`) | Out of scope |

---

## 8. Verification Criteria

| Scenario | Expected Result |
|---|---|
| Start voice session against Kings stage | Bootstrap succeeds, `Room` connects, mic publishes, remote audio subscribes |
| Speak a question | No transcript appears in `messages` yet (v1 defers live rendering per FR-05); TTS audio plays as the worker responds over the connected `Room` |
| Worker responds | Assistant reply is heard as TTS over the `Room`; its text is buffered internally, not yet shown |
| Bootstrap fails (e.g. bad config, network down) | User-visible error, same quality as an existing text-turn failure; app returns to idle, no stuck "connecting" state |
| End voice session | `Room` disconnects, `AVAudioSession` deactivates per the companion doc, the buffered exchange appears in `messages` as a plain transcript, dictation mic button becomes available again |
| Existing text-turn flow, no voice session ever started | Behaves identically to today — `ConversationResponse` decode unaffected by the new optional `voice` field |

---

## 9. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 — Wire model + bootstrap (no LiveKit yet)

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Add `VoicePayload` + `ConversationResponse.voice` | Unit-testable without any LiveKit dependency |
| 1.2 | Add `createVoiceBootstrapPayload`/`bootstrapVoiceSession` to `ConciergeChatService` | Verify against real Kings stage response shape once backend confirms `livekit-bootstrap` support for iOS's surface |

### Phase 2 — LiveKit dependency + Room connection

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Add LiveKit Swift SDK dependency (Package.swift/Podfile/podspec) | Coordinate version choice with the AVAudioSession doc's OQ-1 |
| 2.2 | `VoiceSessionController`: connect, mic publish (using the companion doc's audio-session policy), remote audio subscribe | |

### Phase 3 — Data channel + UI wiring

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Data-channel message types + parser | Field/type names must match `LiveKitContracts.ts` exactly |
| 3.2 | `ChatController.startVoiceSession/stopVoiceSession`; `VoiceSessionController` buffers transcript/turn text; append as a plain transcript to `messages` on session end | Per FR-05 — no live/incremental wiring in this phase |
| 3.3 | Mic/dictation mutual-exclusion gating | Enforces FR-06 |

### Deferred

- Barge-in detection, processing/reconnect watchdogs, optimistic mute-rollback (full
  `LiveKitVoiceManager.ts` parity) — add only if the happy-path demo surfaces a real need.
- SDK modularization (OQ-1).
- Live per-turn UI during the call (incremental transcript, cards/CTAs) — per FR-05/ADR-011, add
  only if requested after the first demo.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adding LiveKit to the core `AEPBrandConcierge` target increases binary size for all consumers, including ones that never use voice | High (certain) | Medium | Accepted trade-off for the PoC timeline (Option B); tracked as OQ-1 for resolution before a real release |
| Data-channel field/type names drift from `LiveKitContracts.ts` over time (two independently maintained clients) | Medium | High (breaks interop with the shared backend worker) | Field/type names copied verbatim in this design (§6.2); flag any web-side contract change to the iOS team and vice versa |
| `ConversationResponse`'s new `voice` field interacts badly with an existing decode edge case (e.g. a custom decoder elsewhere assuming a fixed key set) | Low | Medium | NFR-02 test case (§6.6) exercises decode with and without the key |
| Bootstrap and Room-connection error paths diverge in quality/coverage from each other (bootstrap well-handled, Room-connect failures not) | Medium | Medium | FR-07 sets bootstrap error handling to existing-text-turn quality; Room-connect failure handling should get the same bar in Phase 2, not skipped |

---

## 11. Open Questions

| # | Question | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| OQ-1 | Should LiveKit remain a direct dependency of `AEPBrandConcierge` past this PoC, or move to an optional SPM product/CocoaPods subspec (Rejected Alternative C) before any broader release? | Anshika/Jose, iOS team |
| OQ-2 | Should `VoiceSessionController` be split into a transport layer and a turn-state-machine layer (mirroring web's `VoiceTransport`/`LiveKitVoiceManager` split) once real device testing is underway, or does the combined PoC version stay maintainable? | iOS team, revisit after Phase 2/3 |
| OQ-3 | Does the `USE_TEMPS` debug shortcut in `ConciergeChatService` need an equivalent for voice bootstrap testing, or should voice testing always require real Kings stage config (as already established for text)? | iOS team |
| OQ-4 | ~~Does the demo require sources/multimodal-element/feedback-eligibility parity for voice turns, or is a plain streaming text bubble sufficient for the initial demo to Mehul?~~ **Resolved (2026-09-14, see ADR-011):** no — v1 ships a plain post-call transcript with no live rendering or rich content at all (FR-05); parity is added later only if Mehul asks for it after seeing the first demo. | — resolved |
| OQ-5 | If/when a later iteration adds live rendering (per Mehul's feedback), does it reuse `streamAgentResponse`'s incremental accumulation pattern as originally planned, or does the buffered v1 design make a different approach easier? | iOS team, revisit if/when triggered |
